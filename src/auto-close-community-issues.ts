              `Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ We appreciate your interest, but this is probably not the right place. 
              All the code in this repository is auto-generated using 
              [cdktf-provider-project](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-project) and 
              [cdktf-repository-manager](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-repository-manager) from the source 
              [Terraform provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-${providerName}). 
              If there are problems, they should be addressed in one of those 3 repositories, not here, 
              as any changes here will just get overwritten the next time there is an update upstream. 
              Please open a new issue or PR in one of those repos. In the meantime, I'll auto-close this. 
              Thanks!`.replace(/\s+/g, " "),
